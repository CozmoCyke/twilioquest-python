From the early days of the City of Python, there was a strict order of succession if any ill should befall the leader of the city. The last known order of succession were these five leaders: `Isabelle`, `Grace`, `Charlotte`, `LeBron`, and `Steve`.

In `lists.py`, create a [list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp) called `order_of_succession`. Add all five leaders to it, in the order they appear above. Once your code does this, click the *HACK* button.
