# An Unexpected Challenge

In a collapsed alcove of the ritual chamber, you find a hidden chest that has been secured with a lock like the others you've encountered. This clearly was not a part of the citizenship trials, but you sense that there may be worthwhile rewards within.

You don't see any of Toledo's research notes nearby, but you do see [a tattered scroll that references the official Python documentation for creating classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html). This is your only guidance for the challenge described on the "Objective" tab.

You suspect that Python classes will be covered in further depth another time in the future, so there is no immediate need to open the chest. However, your curiosity has been known to get the better of you...

## Getting started

As instructed, you create a file called `citizen.py` in your code folder:

```bash
<%= env.TQ_PYTHON_CODE_PATH.value %>
```

...and begin to work, trusting in your skills and instincts. You know that, as before, when your code is ready for evaluation, you can click the *HACK* button to see if it is correct.
