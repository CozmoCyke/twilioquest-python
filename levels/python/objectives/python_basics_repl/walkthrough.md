# Toledo's Trial Notes

Once again, you see that Toledo Van Possum has been here first to attempt this trial.

<p>
Of course, the legendary Trial of Trial and Error - the early Pythonistas were never far from their trusty REPL, which they could use to quickly try out code without needing to create a full program. This trial made sure that the aspiring citizen was aware of this handy tool.
</p>

<p>
The REPL is useful while you are learning, since it provides fast feedback on bits of Python code you might want to try. There's also the handy <code>help()</code> command which provides useful tips and tricks about using Python. Now to get down to business and pass this trial myself...

## Tips and Tricks

Looking through the rest of the journal entry, you find some possibly useful tips on how to complete this trial.

<details>
<summary>Why do I care about a REPL?</summary>

A [REPL](https://pythonprogramminglanguage.com/repl/) is a tool you can use to experiment with code without needing to create a full program. Want to just type in a few lines of code to see what happens? REPL to the rescue!

<summary>How do I use the REPL?</summary>

When you install Python, a REPL is one of the tools that is also installed for you. You can launch the REPL from your Terminal by typing the `python3` alone, with no additional arguments. Launch your terminal now and just type in:

<pre style="padding:5px;background-color:#232323;color:#eee;">python3</pre>

When you do, you'll see a prompt that looks something like this:

<pre style="padding:5px;background-color:#232323;color:#eee;">Python 3.7.4 (v3.7.4:e09359112e, Jul  8 2019, 14:54:52) 
[Clang 6.0 (clang-600.0.57)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
</pre>

You can use this interactive, text-based interface to type in lines of Python code that will be evaluated once you press your "Enter" key. There are a number of built-in functions you can use - type in `help()`, for instance, to launch an interactive Python help program.

When you're finished using the REPL, type:

```python
quit()
```

This will end your REPL session and take you back to your terminal interface.

<summary>How do I use the REPL to pass this trial?</summary>

To complete this trial, launch the REPL interface. Use it to answer the questions on the right. Once you have done so, click *HACK* to check your answers and complete the trial!
