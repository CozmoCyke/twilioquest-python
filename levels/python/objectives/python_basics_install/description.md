# The Trial of Installation

Aspiring citizens of the ancient City of Python began their journey as all Python developers do - by __installing Python 3__ on their computers. Get it from the [Windows Store (recommended for PC users)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-37/9nj46sx7x90p) or from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You must begin your journey in this same way. To prove that you are ready to become a Python programmer, provide the __full path to the `python3` executable__ on your computer after you install it. If you're not sure how to install Python 3 or how to find the path, __read the "Help" section__ of this challenge.

Paste the full path to your Python executable in the text field on the right and click *HACK*. If your Python installation is valid, you will have completed this trial.
