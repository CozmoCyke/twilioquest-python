# The Trial of Salutation

To pass the __Trial of Salutation__, you must create a Python file called `salutation.py` in a folder on your computer. This folder will be used going forward to store all your code for these trials. In `salutation.py`, write the following code, which prints a traditional greeting to your terminal window:

```python
# Your first line of Python code is below!
print("For the glory of Python!")
```

Execute your code using the `python3` command you installed earlier.

```bash
python3 salutation.py
```

When your code successfully prints this greeting, __paste the full path to your code in the text field__ on the right and click *HACK*. Your code will be evaluated for this trial, and we will save this folder location for future trials.
