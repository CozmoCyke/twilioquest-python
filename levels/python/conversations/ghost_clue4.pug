        It has always been a source of pride that Python is a popular choice 
        for new developers. I kept a grand journal of every programmer whose first 
        line of code was in Python, and it stretched to the depths of the temple.

        No matter how far you go, always remember what it felt like as a newcomer,
        and do all you can to aid the beginner. Blessings of the Fullstack be 
        upon you.
